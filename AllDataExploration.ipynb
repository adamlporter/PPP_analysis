    "\n",
    "One major difficulty in this analysis is that the Census and PPP data use different names for the groups. The PPE uses individual congregrations by their legal (TBA) names, but the Census uses scholarly / official names, which can be different. For example, the Census identifies five groups as \"Anglican\":\n",
    "    Anglican Catholic Church\n",
    "    Anglican Church in America\n",
    "    Anglican Church in North America\n",
    "    Anglican Province of America\n",
    "    Anglican Province of Christ the King\n",
    " \n",
    "The \"Anglican Church in NA\" has the most congregrations (873), while the other four have a total of less than 200. None of these report the number of adherents. But most \"Anglican\" churches names don't use these names. To which group does \"St. Paul's Anglican Church\" belong? The PPP data doesn't allow us to determine this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Census has data about different Jewish groups (\"Reform Judaism\", \"Conservative Judaism\"), but many synagogues don't use these terms in their names: is \"Temple Israel\" a reform, conservative, or some other branch of Judaism?\n",
